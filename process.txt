Route for test install: (Computer Account)/Store/localdev/test-tailwindcss

Name for new install: 'test-tailwindcss'


Head to:  https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss

Following install steps:
1. Install Tailwind CSS

(Terminal) CD Store/localdev/test-tailwindcss

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init



- - check folder. No post.config.js file installed! :(

Okay, how about if we try only installing postcss in that folder:  npm install postcss

Same issues reported.

'105 vulnerabilities (1 low, 49 moderate, 50 high, 5 critical)'


Right, let's run 'npm audit' to see what's going on....

The report is, umm, extensive; but even if we focus on just the postcss part - it's doesn't resolve anything.







Rest of the process written (below) only for reference...


2. Add Tailwind to your PostCSS configuration - (insert code in 'postcss.config.js'

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}

3. Configure your template paths - (insert code in 'tailwind.config.js')

content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],

4. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS

5. Start your build process using: npm run dev
